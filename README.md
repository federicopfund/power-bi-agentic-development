## Installation

These skills are intended for use in Claude Code, Desktop, or Cowork. However, you can use them in other tools like GitHub Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI.

### Claude Code

Enter the following commands in the terminal:

Add marketplace:
```bash
# Add marketplace source (if not already added)
claude plugin marketplace add data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development
```

Then in Claude Code you can install the plugins via `/plugin` and navigating to the installed marketplace.

**TIP:** Make sure that you enable marketplace auto-update!

![Marketplace auto-update](media/marketplace-auto-update.png)

Alternative - Add plugins via command line: 

```bash
# Install plugins
claude plugin install tabular-editor@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install pbi-desktop@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install semantic-models@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install reports@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install pbip@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install fabric-cli@power-bi-agentic-development
```

### GitHub Copilot

The standalone [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli) supports plugin installation from GitHub repos. Consult the Copilot documentation for specifics if you have difficulties with installation, or open an issue in this repo.

```bash
copilot plugin install data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development
```

> **Note:** Some plugin features like agents and hooks may behave differently across tools. The core knowledge in the skill files is tool-agnostic.

### Commands

> In Claude Code, slash commands and skills have coalesced. Commands are simply more prescriptive workflows, but they take the same structure as a skill.
> Skills are not workflows nor should they be prescriptive.

| Command | Plugin | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| [`/suggest-rule`](plugins/tabular-editor/commands/suggest-rule.md) | tabular-editor | Generate BPA rules from descriptions |
| [`/audit-context`](plugins/fabric-cli/commands/audit-context.md) | fabric-cli | Review project context files (CLAUDE.md, agents.md, memory files) |

### Hooks

> Hooks run automatically to validate files after edits.

| Hook | Plugin | Trigger | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| PBIR validation hooks (2) | pbip | `Write\|Edit` or `Bash` on `.Report/` `.json`/`.pbir` files | Automatically validates pbir; prevents agent mistakes |
| TMDL validation hooks (2) | pbip | `Write\|Edit` or `Bash` on `.tmdl` files | Automatically validates TMDL; prevents agent mistakes; doesn't parse DAX/M |
